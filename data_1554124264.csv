10.1103/PhysRevD.73.057303,2006-03-24,We study the possibility to explain the nonbaryonic dark matter abundance and improve the present fits on the muon anomalous magnetic moment through the same new physics In this work we show that massive brane fluctuations branons in large extra dimensions models can provide an economical way to deal with these two issues This is so because the low energy branon physics depends effectively on essentially only three parameters Next collider experiments such as LHC or ILC will be sensitive to branon phenomenology in the natural parameter region where the theory is able to account for the two effects
10.1103/PhysRevA.73.043802,2006-04-05,We analytically study the linear propagation of arbitrarily shaped light pulses through an absorbing medium with a narrow transparency window or through a resonant amplifying medium We point out that under certain general conditions the pulse acquires a nearly Gaussian shape irrespective of its initial shape and of the spectral profile of the line We explicitly derive in this case the pulse parameters including its skewness responsible for a deviation of the delay of the pulse maximum from the group delay We illustrate our general results by analyzing the slow light experiments having demonstrated the largest fractional pulse delays
10.1103/PhysRevD.73.083515,2006-04-12,The effects of mass varying neutrinos on cosmic microwave background CMB anisotropies and large scale structures LSS are studied In these models dark energy and neutrinos are coupled such that the neutrino masses are functions of the scalar field playing the role of dark energy We begin by describing the cosmological background evolution of such a system It is pointed out that similar to models with a dark matter dark energy interaction the apparent equation of state measured with SNIa can be smaller than We then discuss the effect of mass varying neutrinos on the CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum A suppression of power in the CMB power spectrum at large angular scales is usually observed We give an explanation for this behavior and discuss different couplings and quintessence potentials to show the generality of the results obtained We perform a likelihood analysis using wide ranging SNIa CMB and LSS observations to assess whether such theories are viable Treating the neutrino mass as a free parameter we find that the constraints on the coupling are weak since CMB and LSS surveys give only upper bounds on the neutrino mass However fixing a priori the neutrino masses we find that there is some evidence that the existence of such a coupling is actually preferred by current cosmological data over the standard CDM cosmology
10.1103/PhysRevA.74.013611,2006-07-14,We present a three dimensional quantum mechanical theory of radio frequency outcoupled atom lasers from trapped atomic gases in the presence of the gravitational force Predictions for the total outcoupling rate as a function of the radio frequency and for the beam wave function are given We establish a sum rule for the energy integrated outcoupling which leads to a separate determination of the coupling strength between the atoms and radiation field For a noninteracting Bose Einstein condensate analytic solutions are derived which are subsequently extended to include the effects of atomic interactions The interactions enhance interference effects in the beam profile and modify the outcoupling rate of the atom laser We provide a complete quantum mechanical solution which is in line with experimental findings and allows us to determine the validity of commonly used approximative methods We also extend the formalism to a fermionic atom laser and analyze the effect of superfluidity on the outcoupling of atoms
10.1103/PhysRevB.74.052405,2006-08-24,The effects of pressure on the nickel hydrides Ni H x with different hydrogen concentrations x and have been extensively studied using the ab initio pseudopotential plane wave method A pressure induced ferromagnetic FM to paramagnetic PM phase transition has been predicted The hydrogen concentration pressure phase diagram up to several megabar has been obtained The transition pressure from FM to PM decreases with increasing hydrogen concentration It is found that the electron transfers from p and s to d inside each Ni atom and from p and s of Ni atoms to H s are the main causes of the hydrogen doping induced magnetic transition while the electron transfers from the nearest neighbor Ni p to H s the nearest neighbor Ni p to the further Ni s and from p to s and d inside each Ni atom mainly contribute to the pressure induced magnetic transition
10.1103/PhysRevB.74.115202,2006-09-11,We investigate the influence of poly ethylenedioxythiophene poly styrenesulfonate PEDOT PSS on the optoelectronic properties of polymer light emitting diodes containing poly dioctylfluorene PFO Electromodulation and I V luminance measurements are reported for a series of devices with bare indium tin oxide ITO or PEDOT PSS coated ITO anodes and Ba or Al cathodes The ITO PFO Al ITO PFO Ba and ITO PEDOT PSS PFO Al devices all exhibit conventional field induced electromodulation behavior in both forward and reverse bias consistent with the Stark effect SE The ITO PEDOT PSS PFO Ba devices by contrast exhibit conventional behavior only for applied biases below the flat band voltage at higher biases the field induced SE features vanish and are replaced by anomalous charge induced electromodulation features This anomalous behavior is observed only when PEDOT PSS is used in conjunction with a strongly electron injecting cathode such as Ba and is attributed to the presence of trapped electrons at the PEDOT PSS emitter interface which screen the electric field from the bulk of the device The enhanced field at the interface increases the rate of field assisted hole injection into the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO of the PFO resulting in lower drive voltages and increased electroluminescence efficiencies

10.1103/PhysRevC.74.044901,2006-10-04,An overwhelming fraction of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions has its origin in the decay of and mesons We calculate the azimuthal asymmetry of the decay photons for several azimuthally asymmetric pion distributions We find that the k T dependence of the elliptic flow parameter v for the decay photons closely follows the elliptic flow parameter v evaluated at p T k T where GeV for typical pion distributions measured in nucleus nucleus collisions at relativistic energies Similar results are obtained for photons from the decay of mesons Assuming that the flow of is similar to those for and for which independent measurements would be generally available this ansatz can help in identifying additional sources for photons Taken along with quark number scaling suggested by the recombination model it may help to estimate v of the parton distributions in terms of azimuthal asymmetry of the decay photons at large k T
10.1103/PhysRevB.74.184301,2006-11-01,We have studied the vibrational properties of Cu Al O by means of Raman scattering in ambient conditions at low temperature and also at high pressure Results are discussed in the framework of an ab initio calculation Raman active modes have wave numbers E g cm and A g cm Polarized measurements with single crystals have confirmed their symmetry We present and discuss the phonon dispersion curves Below K the temperature dependence of the Raman active modes is almost linear with coefficients E g T cm K and A g T cm K Most of the temperature shift is associated with thermal expansion The pressure dependence is given by E g P cm GPa and A g P cm GPa We observe a reversible phase transition at GPa which as already has been shown to happen in Cu Ga O we relate to the existence of a dynamical instability
10.1103/PhysRevD.75.068302,2007-03-15,This is a reply to Rauscher Phys Rev D We studied heavy element production in the high baryon density region in the early universe Phys Rev D However it is claimed by Rauscher Phys Rev D that a small scale but high baryon density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in order not to contradict the observations the high density region must be so small that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in the high baryon density region and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough of the heavy element without contradiction to cosmic microwave background and light element observations
10.1103/PhysRevC.75.031901,2007-03-20,We find that a simple extension of the coalescence model is sufficient to incorporate the perfect quark number scaling behavior of the elliptic flow in transverse kinetic energy recently discovered by the PHENIX Collaboration The flavor dependence of the elliptic flow can be consistently described in the low and intermediate p T if the transverse kinetic energy is conserved in the or parton coalescence process at the hadronization Thus suggesting the quark coalescence as a possible hadronization mechanism at low p T as well
10.1103/PhysRevE.75.051923,2007-05-30,We show that introducing periodic planar fronts with long excitation duration can lead to spiral attenuation The attenuation occurs periodically over cycles of several planar fronts forming a variety of complex spatiotemporal patterns We find that these attenuation patterns occur only at specific phases of the descending fronts relative to the rotational phase of the spiral These patterns fall into two general classes each defined by a specific expression for the number of attenuated spirals per cycle of planar fronts and represented by a structured diagram in parameter space The spiral attenuation patterns we observe remain stable in time and do not change during the evolution of the system
10.1103/PhysRevE.75.060901,2007-06-20,We present a model for predicting the spatial intensity correlation function of dynamic speckle patterns formed by light backscattered from turbid suspensions and an experimental validation of these predictions The spatial correlation varies remarkably with multiple scattering The provided computational scheme is a step towards correctly interpreting signals obtained from instruments based on the measurement of dynamic speckle patterns in the far field
10.1103/PhysRevE.75.061123,2007-06-27,We perform a time dependent study of the driven dynamics of overdamped particles that are placed in a one dimensional piecewise linear random potential This setup of spatially quenched disorder then exerts a dichotomous varying random force on the particles We derive the path integral representation of the resulting probability density function for the position of the particles and transform this quantity of interest into the form of a Fourier integral In doing so the evolution of the probability density can be investigated analytically for finite times It is demonstrated that the probability density contains both a singular contribution and a regular part While the former part plays a dominant role at short times the latter rules the behavior at large evolution times The slow approach of the probability density to a limiting Gaussian form as time tends to infinity is elucidated in detail

10.1103/PhysRevB.76.014427,2007-07-23,Spectra of x ray absorption were measured at the L p and M d edges of Ce in multilayers Ce x Si x Fe x n x between and with single phase amorphous Ce x Si x sublayers The study uncovers the highly correlated nature of this layered system an phase like electronic configuration of Ce is observed which indicates considerable hybridization between the f and conduction band states This is at variance with single alloy films Ce x Si x which show a phase like Ce configuration already at x X ray magnetic circular dichroism measured at the L edges of Ce in the multilayers reveals magnetic order on the d electrons induced by the interaction with Fe at the interfaces With increasing the Si content the strength of the f conduction band hybridization is reduced which is reflected in a growing occupation of the Ce f states Variations of the line shape and intensity of the L edge dichroism spectra are very complex The spectra not only are related to the magnetic d polarization in the ground state but are largely controlled by the exchange interaction between the photoexcited d electron and the f electron which generates a spin dependent enhancement of the radial parts of the p to d matrix element The strength of the f d exchange interaction can be controlled by varying the composition of the Ce x Si x sublayers At high Si concentration and low temperature it induces a change in sign of the dichroic signal We present a detailed discussion within a simple phenomenological model
10.1103/PhysRevE.76.026310,2007-08-21,The rotation of a single spheroid in a planar Couette flow as a model for simple shear flow is numerically simulated with the distributed Lagrangian multiplier based fictitious domain method The study is focused on the effects of inertia on the orbital behavior of prolate and oblate spheroids The numerical orbits are found to be well described by a simple empirical model which states that the rate of the spheroid rotation about the vorticity axis is a sinusoidal function of the corresponding projection angle in the flow gradient plane and that the exponential growth rate of the orbit function is a constant The following transitions in the steady state with increasing Reynolds number are identified Jeffery orbit tumbling quasi Jeffery orbit log rolling and inclined rolling for a prolate spheroid and Jeffery orbit log rolling inclined rolling and motionless state for an oblate spheroid In addition it is shown that the orbit behavior is sensitive to the initial orientation in the case of strong inertia and there exist different steady states for certain shear Reynolds number regimes

10.1103/PhysRevA.77.012114,2008-01-29,A quantum holonomy reflects the curvature of some underlying structure of quantum mechanical systems such as that associated with quantum states Here we extend the notion of holonomy to families of quantum channels i e trace preserving completely positive maps By the use of the Jamio kowski isomorphism we show that the proposed channel holonomy is related to the Uhlmann holonomy The general theory is illustrated for specific examples We put forward a physical realization of the channel holonomy in terms of interferometry This enables us to identify a gauge invariant physical object that directly relates to the channel holonomy Parallel transport condition and concomitant gauge structure are delineated in the case of smoothly parametrized families of channels Finally we point out that interferometer tests that have been carried out in the past to confirm the rotation symmetry of the neutron spin can be viewed as early experimental realizations of the channel holonomy

10.1103/PhysRevB.77.115115,2008-03-12,The insulator to metal transition in La Ti O induced by La substitution via Sr is studied within multiband exact diagonalization dynamical mean field theory at finite temperatures It is shown that weak hole doping triggers a large interorbital charge transfer with simultaneous electron and hole doping of t g subbands The transition is first order and exhibits phase separation between insulator and metal In the metallic phase subband compressibilities become very large and have opposite signs Electron doping gives rise to an interorbital charge flow in the same direction as hole doping These results can be understood in terms of a strong orbital depolarization
10.1103/PhysRevB.77.144508,2008-04-04,We discuss the hydrodynamic boundary condition for a superfluid moving tangentially to a rough surface Specifically we argue that the scattering of quantum fluctuations off surface roughness affects the nature of the boundary condition and that this has important consequences including a theorized critical speed and the presence of normal fluid at any nonzero speed even if the boundary is held at zero temperature i e a moving superfluid flow creates a sustained temperature difference between the superfluid and the boundary This hydrodynamic boundary condition is relevant not only for superfluid helium experiments but also for experiments with trapped dilute Bose Einstein condensates in particular those involving atomic waveguides near surfaces
10.1103/PhysRevC.77.044006,2008-04-25,The renormalization of the chiral np interaction in the S channel to next to next to next to leading order N LO in Weinberg counting for the long distance potential with one single momentum and energy independent counterterm is carried out This renormalization scheme yields finite and unique results and is free of short distance off shell ambiguities We observe good convergence in the entire elastic range below pion production threshold and find that there are some small physical effects missing in the purely pionic chiral NN potential with or without inclusion of explicit degrees of freedom We also study the renormalizability of the standard Weinberg counting at next to leading order NLO and next to next to leading order N LO when a momentum dependent polynomial counterterm is included Our numerical results suggest that the inclusion of this counterterm does not yield a convergent amplitude at NLO and N LO

10.1103/PhysRevE.79.041117,2009-04-10,We consider motion of an underdamped Brownian particle in a washboard potential that is subjected to an unbiased time periodic external field While in the limiting deterministic system in dependence of the strength and phase of the external field directed net motion can exist for a finite temperature the net motion averages to zero Strikingly with the application of an additional time delayed feedback term directed particle motion can be accomplished persisting up to fairly high levels of the thermal noise In detail there exist values of the feedback strength and delay time for which the feedback term performs oscillations that are phase locked to the time periodic external field This yields an effective biasing rocking force promoting periods of forward and backward motion of distinct duration and thus directed motion In terms of phase space dynamics we demonstrate that with applied feedback desymmetrization of coexisting attractors takes place leaving the ones supporting either positive or negative velocities as the only surviving ones Moreover we found parameter ranges for which in the presence of thermal noise the directed transport is enhanced compared to the noiseless case

10.1103/PhysRevD.79.115017,2009-06-23,The symmetry imposed on the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis is known to be quite predictive We integrate this very specific neutrino symmetry into a more general framework based on the supersymmetric S O grand unified theory As in several other models the fermion mass spectrum is determined by Hermitian mass matrices resulting from the renormalizable Yukawa couplings of the plet of fermions with the Higgs fields transforming as and representations of the S O group The symmetry is spontaneously broken through the plet Consequences of this scheme are considered for fermion masses using both a type I and a type II seesaw mechanism This scenario is shown to lead to a generalized C P invariance of the mass matrices and vanishing C P violating phases if the Yukawa couplings are invariant under the symmetry Small explicit breaking of the symmetry is then shown to provide a very good understanding of all of the fermion masses and mixing Detailed fits to the fermion spectrum are presented in several scenarios One obtains a very good fit to all observables in the context of the type I seesaw mechanism but the type II seesaw model also provides a good description except for the overall scale of the neutrino masses Three major predictions on the leptonic mixing parameters in the type I seesaw case are i the atmospheric mixing angle l close to maximal ii l close to the present upper bound and iii a negative but very small Dirac C P violating phase in the neutrino oscillations
10.1103/PhysRevA.80.013608,2009-07-15,We consider a system of three identical bosons near a Feshbach resonance in the universal regime with large scattering length usually described by model independent zero range potentials We employ the adiabatic hyperspherical approximation and derive the rigorous large distance equation for the adiabatic potential for finite range interactions The effective range correction to the zero range approximation must be supplemented by a new term of the same order The nonadiabatic term can be decisive Efimov physics is always confined to the range between effective range and scattering length The analytical results agree with numerical calculations for realistic potentials

10.1103/PhysRevD.81.104045,2010-05-27,Motivated by Verlinde s theory of entropic gravity we give a tentative explanation to the Coulomb s law with an entropic force When trying to do this we find the equipartition rule should be extended to charges and the concept of temperature should be reinterpreted If one accepts the holographic principle as well as our generalizations and reinterpretations then Coulomb s law the Poisson equation and the Maxwell equations can be derived smoothly Our attempt can be regarded as a new way to unify the electromagnetic force with gravity from the entropic origin Possibly some of our postulates are related to the D brane picture of black hole thermodynamics
10.1103/PhysRevB.81.235410,2010-06-07,The Si surface with an average coverage of slightly more than one monolayer of Sn exhibits a reconstruction below K In the literature atomic structure models with or Sn atoms in the unit cell have been proposed based on scanning tunneling microscopy STM results even though only four Sn atoms could be resolved in the unit cell This paper deals with two issues regarding this surface First high resolution angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ARPES and STM are used to test theoretically derived results from an atomic structure model comprised of Sn atoms ten in an underlayer and four in a top layer C T rnevik M Hammar N G Nilsson and S A Flodstr m Phys Rev B Low temperature ARPES reveals six occupied surface states The calculated surface band structure only reproduces some of these surface states However simulated STM images show that certain properties of the four atoms that are visible in STM are reproduced by the model The electronic structure of the Sn atoms in the underlayer of the model does not correspond to any features seen in the ARPES results STM images are presented which indicate the presence of a different underlayer consisting of eight Sn atoms which is not compatible with the model These results indicate that a revised model is called for The second issue is the reversible transition from a phase below K to a phase corresponding to a molten Sn layer above that temperature It is found that the surface band structure just below the transition temperature is quite similar to that at K The surface band structure undergoes a dramatic change at the transition A strong surface state showing a periodicity can be detected above the transition temperature This state resembles parts of two surface states which already before the transition temperature is reached have begun a transformation and lost much of their periodicities Calculated surface band structures obtained from models with one monolayer of Sn are compared with ARPES and STM results It is found that the strong surface state present above the transition temperature shows a dispersion similar to that of a calculated surface band originating from the Sn Si interface with the Sn atoms in T sites
10.1103/PhysRevE.81.066204,2010-06-09,Bred vectors are a type of finite perturbation used in prediction studies of atmospheric models that exhibit spatially extended chaos We study the structure spatial correlations and the growth rates of logarithmic bred vectors which are constructed by using a given norm We find that after a suitable transformation logarithmic bred vectors are roughly piecewise copies of the leading Lyapunov vector This fact allows us to deduce a scaling law for the bred vector growth rate as a function of its amplitude In addition we relate growth rates with the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents corresponding to the most expanding directions We illustrate our results with simulations of the Lorenz model

10.1103/PhysRevD.82.021501,2010-07-22,We give a prescription to define in loop quantum gravity the electric field operator related to the scale factor of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological space time This procedure allows us to link the fundamental theory with its cosmological implementation In view of the conjugate relation existing between holonomies and fluxes the edge length and the area of surfaces in the fiducial metric satisfy a duality condition As a consequence the area operator has a discrete spectrum also in loop quantum cosmology This feature makes the super Hamiltonian regularization an open issue of the whole formulation

10.1103/PhysRevE.90.012802,2014-07-02,I examine the mean consensus time i e exit time of the voter model in the so called two clique graph The two clique graph is composed of two cliques interconnected by some links and considered as a toy model of networks with community structure or multilayer networks I analytically show that as the number of interclique links per node is varied the mean consensus time experiences a crossover between a fast consensus regime i e O N and a slow consensus regime i e O N where N is the number of nodes The fast regime is consistent with the result for homogeneous well mixed graphs such as the complete graph The slow regime appears only when the entire network has O interclique links The present results suggest that the effect of community structure on the consensus time of the voter model is fairly limited
10.1103/PhysRevD.90.083519,2014-10-20,The primordial lithium abundance inferred from spectroscopic observations of metal poor stars is times smaller than the theoretical prediction in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis BBN model We assume a simple model composed of standard model particles and a sterile neutrino H with mass of O MeV which decays long after BBN We then investigate cosmological effects of a sterile neutrino decay and check if a sterile neutrino can reduce the primordial lithium abundance We formulate the injection spectrum of nonthermal photon induced by the H decay We take into account the generation of electrons and positrons e s and active neutrinos at the H decay the primary photon production via the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic background radiation CBR by energetic e and electromagnetic cascade showers induced by the primary photons The steady state injection spectrum is then derived as a function of the H mass and the photon temperature The H decay produces energetic active neutrinos which are not thermalized and e s which are thermalized We then derive formulas relevant to the H decay rates and formulas for the baryon to photon ratio and effective neutrino number N eff The initial abundance mass and lifetime of H are taken as free parameters We then consistently solve the cosmic thermal history nonthermal nucleosynthesis induced by the nonthermal photons the value and the N eff value We find that an effective Be destruction can occur only if the sterile neutrino decays at photon temperature T O keV Amounts of energy injection at the H decay are constrained from limits on primordial D and Li abundances the N eff value and the CBR energy spectrum We find that Be is photodisintegrated and the Li problem is partially solved for the lifetime s and the mass MeV Be destruction by more than a factor of is not possible because of an associated D overdestruction In the parameter region the value is decreased slightly while the N eff value is increased by a factor of N eff In this study errors in photodisintegration cross sections of Be He and Li H that have propagated through the literature are corrected and new functions are derived based on recent nuclear experiments It is found that the new photodisintegration rates are to times smaller than the old rates The correct cross sections thus indicate significantly smaller efficiencies of Be and Li photodisintegration Abundances of sterile neutrino necessary for the Li reduction are much smaller than thermal freeze out abundances The relic sterile neutrino therefore must be diluted between the freeze out and BBN epochs by some mechanism
10.1103/PhysRevD.90.114006,2014-12-01,The W W cross section has remained one of the most consistently discrepant channels compared to Standard Model SM predictions at the LHC measured by both ATLAS and CMS at and TeV Developing a better modeling of this channel is crucial to understanding properties of the Higgs and potential new physics In this paper we investigate the effects of next to next to leading log transverse momentum resummation in measuring the W W cross section In the formalism we employ transverse momentum resummation does not change the total inclusive cross section but gives a more accurate prediction for the p T distribution of the diboson system By reweighting the p T distribution of events produced by Monte Carlo generators we find a systematic shift that decreases the experimental discrepancy with the SM prediction by approximately depending on the Monte Carlo generator and parton shower used The primary effect comes from the jet veto cut used by both experiments We comment on the connections to jet veto resummation and other methods the experiments can use to test this effect We also discuss the correlation of resummation effects in this channel with other diboson channels Ultimately p T resummation improves the agreement between the SM and experimental measurements for most generators but does not account for the measured difference with the SM and further investigations into this channel are needed
10.1103/PhysRevE.91.031001,2015-03-10,At high angles of attack an aircraft wing stalls This dreaded event is characterized by the development of a leading edge vortex on the upper surface of the wing followed by its shedding which causes a drastic drop in the aerodynamic lift At similar angles of attack the leading edge vortex on an insect wing or an autorotating seed membrane remains robustly attached ensuring high sustained lift What are the mechanisms responsible for both leading edge vortex attachment and high lift generation on revolving wings We review the three main hypotheses that attempt to explain this specificity and using direct numerical simulations of the Navier Stokes equations we show that the latter originates in Coriolis effects

10.1103/PhysRevB.91.241402,2015-06-10,We describe the conductance of a normal superconducting junction in systems with Landau levels that preserve time reversal symmetry Those Landau levels have been observed in strained honeycomb lattices The current is carried along the edges in both the normal and superconducting regions When the Landau levels in the normal region are half filled the Andreev reflection is maximal and the conductance plateaus have a peak as a function of the filling factor The height of those peaks is quantized at e h The interface of the junction has Andreev edge states which form a coherent superposition of electrons and holes that can carry a net valley current We identify unique experimental signatures for superconductivity in time reversal invariant Landau levels

10.1103/PhysRevD.92.054033,2015-09-25,Heavy resonances are an integral part of many extensions of the standard model The discovery of such heavy resonances are a primary goal at the LHC and future hadron colliders When a particle with TeV scale mass decays into electroweak scale objects these objects are highly boosted and their decay products are then strongly collimated possibly to an extent that they cannot be resolved in the calorimeters of the detectors any more We develop taggers for electroweak scale resonances by combining the good energy resolution of the hadronic calorimeter with the superior spatial resolution of the tracking detector Using track based techniques we reconstruct heavy W and Z bosons and constrain the branching ratio of the rare Higgs boson decay H Z A l l jets The taggers show a good momentum independent performance up to very large boosts Using the proposed techniques will allow experiments at the LHC and a future hadron collider to significantly extend its reach in searches for heavy resonances

10.1103/PhysRevB.92.184503,2015-11-04,We report on studies of quantum turbulence with second sound in superfluid He in which the turbulence is generated by the flow of the superfluid component through a wide square channel the ends of which are plugged with sintered silver superleaks the flow being generated by compression of a bellows The superleaks ensure that there is no net flow of the normal fluid In an earlier paper S Babuin et al Phys Rev B we have shown that steady flow of this kind generates a density of vortex lines that is essentially identical to that generated by thermal counterflow when the average relative velocity between the two fluids is the same In this paper we report on studies of the temporal decay of the vortex line density observed when the bellows is stopped and we compare the results with those obtained from the temporal decay of thermal counterflow remeasured in the same channel and under the same conditions In both cases there is an initial fast decay which for low enough initial line density approaches for a short time the form t characteristic of the decay of a random vortex tangle This is followed at late times by a slower t decay characteristic of the decay of large quasiclassical eddies However in the range of investigated parameters we observe always in the case of thermal counterflow and only in a few cases of high steady state velocity in superflow an intermediate regime in which the decay either does not proceed monotonically with time or passes through a point of inflexion This difference established firmly by our experiments might represent one essential ingredient for the full theoretical understanding of counterflow turbulence
10.1103/PhysRevB.92.245113,2015-12-09,We analyze the magnetic form factor of Cu in low dimensional quantum magnets by taking the metal ligand hybridization into account explicitly In this analysis we use the form of magnetic Wannier orbitals derived from first principles calculations and identify contributions of different atomic sites We demonstrate that covalency of metal ligand interactions has a strong effect on the magnetic form factor and must be taken into account in the evaluation of magnetic neutron scattering The use of covalent form factors facilitates quantitative description of inelastic neutron scattering data for BaCuSi O that would not be possible when ionic form factors are used We also propose easy to use approximations of the partial orbital contributions to the magnetic form factor in order to give microscopic explanation for the results obtained in previous first principles studies
